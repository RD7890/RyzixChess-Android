# Ryzix Chess — Native Kotlin Android App

Native Android chess app built with Jetpack Compose, replicating RyzixChess (RDChess) in pure Kotlin.

## Features
- Play vs Stockfish (Level 1–12)
- Over the Board (2 players, 1 device)
- Green board + Staunty pieces (Lichess assets)
- Real-time move tracking panel
- Eval bar
- Arrows on board
- Engine settings (search time, MultiPV, CPUs)
- Dark theme matching original app

## Setup

### 1. Add Stockfish Binary
The app needs a Stockfish binary for Android ARM64. Download from:
- https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/releases
- Or copy the ARM64 binary from your existing build

Place the binary at:
```
app/src/main/assets/stockfish
```
Make sure it's the ARM64-v8a build for Android.

## Stack
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose
- `chesslib` — chess rules/logic
- `androidsvg` — Staunty SVG piece rendering
- `datastore-preferences` — persistent settings
- Stockfish 16 via stdin/stdout UCI
